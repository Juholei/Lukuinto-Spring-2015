# Building the project

Nodejs and npm are needed. Command 'npm install' should install further dependencies for building the project based on what is added as requirements in 'package.json'.

After npm has installed all the requirements for building the project, use Bower to install the actual dependencies of the project with command "bower install". This installs the dependencies declared in 'bower.json'.

After installing all the dependencies, command 'grunt serve' builds and runs the game in browser. Command 'grunt build' builds the project into a production build in directory 'dist'. This can then be deployed to webserver and opened in browser.
